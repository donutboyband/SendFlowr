🌸 Why SendFlowr Exists

Email is still one of the highest‑ROI marketing channels, but most brands are leaving money on the table because they send at the wrong time. ESPs offer “send‑time optimization,” but it’s usually just a glorified average — a single hour chosen from historical opens. It’s coarse, opaque, and blind to context.

SendFlowr exists to fix that.

SendFlowr predicts when each individual recipient is most likely to engage, not with a guess or a generic rule, but with a minute‑level probability curve built from real behavioral and contextual signals. Instead of “send at 10 AM,” SendFlowr identifies the exact windows where engagement probability peaks — and adapts in real time as user behavior changes.

This matters because timing isn’t a cosmetic tweak. It’s a multiplier.
A small lift in opens or clicks compounds across every campaign, every segment, every lifecycle flow. Better timing means more revenue, stronger deliverability, and fewer wasted sends.

SendFlowr gives marketers something they’ve never had before:
a precise, data‑driven understanding of when each person is ready to engage.

It’s not an ESP replacement — it’s the intelligence layer ESPs don’t have.
A plug‑in brain that makes every send smarter.

With SendFlowr, brands stop guessing and start sending with intention.
They reach people at the right moment, every time — and the results speak for themselves.
